## The Big Picture
![Storage and Retrieval Island](../images/ch3_island.png){width=60%}


## Why so technical?
> "On a most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you"

- Why should a data engineer care about the ins and outs of database storage and retrieval?
  - **Not** so you can try to design better storage systems from scratch
  - _So you can choose a storage engine to match your needs_
    - A real focus here is on knowing just enough of the field and terminology so that you could make informed decisions and understand documentation that might help you make those decisions.


## A case of indexing
- Writing data to storage and reading the data back from storage frequently have very different needs
- Most methods will enact tradeoffs between the two
  - Storing something quickly will likely make it more difficult to find later
    - Example: Tossing a book into an empty spot on your bookcase
  - Storing something so that it can be quickly found likely takes longer
    - Example: Placing your book in the alphabetically correct location by author
- Using an _index_ will generally assist with retrieval, but costs time on writes to update the index
  - Often only some columns will be indexed for fast retrieval


## Beavers Love them
::::::cols
::::col
- A _log_ in a database sense is an **append-only** sequence of records
- Updated records just have new values assigned later in the log
- Most recent entries to the log have priority
::::

::::col
![A Log](../images/db_log.png)

::::
::::::


## #Hash Indexing
- Stores key-value pairs, where the key is used to determine a _hash_
- Imagine a hash as a sign that says: "Look right here for this value"
- Log of transactions and values are stored on disk, but the hash-map is stored in memory
- When a log gets too large, a new one is started and the old log is compacted
  - New log segment gets a new hash-map in memory
  - Logs are later merged to further compact them
- Pros: sequential writes are good! Crash recovery is simple
- Cons: All the hash maps need to fit in memory. Range queries inefficient


## SSTables
- Still a form of log, so append-only
- Keys are stored in segments in sorted order

![Example SSTable structure$^1$](../images/sstable.png)


## LSM-Tree: Writing
- A _log-structure merge-tree_ stores new writes initially in a _memtable_
- The memtable is really a tree structure that sorts the keys as they come in
- When the tree gets too large, the keys are flushed to a new SSTable on disk

![LSM to SSTable$^1$](../images/lsm_to_sstable.png){width=70%}

## LSM-Tree: Reading
- Would normally still look for a corresponding key in the most recent segment
- Segments can often use an in-memory _sparse index_ that takes advantage of the ordered state of the keys for faster look-ups

![Improving finding speed with a sparse index$^1$](../images/sparse_index.png)


## LSM Cost/Benefit
- Pros
  - Faster look-ups owing to ordered keys
  - Not all keys need to exist in memory
  - Works very well for write-heavy situations, as it only performs sequential writes (which require less disk scanning)
- Cons
  - A crash would lose all the data currently in the memtable that hasn't been written to an SSTable
    - Can also keep an unordered hash table log on disk of all writes whose only existence is to restore the memtable in case of crash
  - Searching for files not in the database still takes a long time as all segments must be searched
    - Using _bloom filters_ can help by immediately reporting if the key is not in the database


## B-Trees
- Most widely used storage architecture
- Constrains segments of key-value pairings by size (often around 4 KB)
- Keys can either point to the value in memory, or they can point to another segment
  - Segments pointing to other segments is where the tree structure comes in


## B-Tree Look-up
![Showing the structure and looking up a key in a B-Tree](../images/b-tree-loopup.png){width=80%}

## B-Tree Writing
- The tree is traversed and the key is attempted to be found
  - If it is, the reference to the value is change **in place**
  - If not, the key and value are added to that correct segment
- If a segment is full (fixed size remember), then it is split into two new segments, each half full.
  - This also forces the parent segment to need to be updated (and possibly split)


## B-Tree Cost/Benefit
- Pros
  - Most values can be accessed in less than 4 segments, making for **very fast read speeds**
    - Also leads to more predictable response times
  - Store each key in only one location, so less chance of competing processes getting confused
- Cons
  - Crashes mid-write can be highly problematic
    - Often keeps a _write-ahead log_ of what is going to be done in case of crash, but this doubles the amount to be written
  - More easily fragment as a result of small amounts of space left between segments


## Different Use Cases
- Large-scale differences in how databases will be used
- OLTP: Online Transaction Processing
- OLAP: Online Analytic Processing

![View of a typical pipeline](../images/oltp_vs_olap.png){width=50%}


## Transaction vs Analytics

| Property    | Transaction Processing (OLTP)                | Analytic Processing (OLAP)              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Read trend  | Small number of records per query            | Aggregate over large numbers of records |
| Write trend | Random-access, low latency writes from users | Bulk import (ELT)                       |
| Used by     | End user or customers                        | Internal analyst                        |
| Represents  | Latest state of data                         | History of data events                  |
| Sizes       | Gigabytes to terabytes                       | Terabytes to petabytes                  |


## Analytic Processing
::::::cols
::::col
- Needs to focus on handling huge queries and aggregates
  - Relational databases a good fit for this
- Frequently end up with "star" or "snowflake" type schematics
  - One central fact table with other surrounding tables containing details
::::

::::col
![A simple star schema](../images/star_schema.png)

::::
::::::

## Analytic Optimizations
- Column-data stored together
  - As opposed to OLTP solutions, where data from a row is stored together
  - Most analysis looks at a single column over all rows, so this makes reads faster
- Compressing column data as bitmaps
  - Makes boolean searches very speedy, as binary arithmetic can be used
- Computing _data cubes_
  - Pre-computing common (and computationally heavy) aggregates in their own table

<section id="why-a-terminal" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why a Terminal?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fair question, in an age of modern GUIs, might be “Why should I
learn to work in a terminal?”
<ul>
<li>Can allow you to perform highly flexible operations that may not be
built into a GUI</li>
<li>Present on any computer you might come across</li>
<li>Connecting to remote systems or servers is increasingly necessary to
access data, and a terminal gives you the most flexible method of doing
so</li>
<li>Most programming languages or IDEs have an option to drop you to a
terminal, so knowing enough to take full advantage is useful</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-even-is-a-terminal" class="slide level2">
<h2>What even is a terminal?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A terminal historically was a piece of hardware to interact with a
computer: entering in information through a keyboard and outputting
information through a monitor</li>
<li>Computers have advanced much since then, so these days a
<em>terminal emulator</em> is generally used to mimic the functionality
of the older hardware terminals
<ul>
<li>Most systems have a terminal emulator of some sort built into the
operating system
<ul>
<li><code class="python">terminal</code> on MacOS</li>
<li><code class="python">cmd</code> on Windows</li>
<li><code class="python">urxvt</code>,
<code class="python">xterm</code>, etc. on Linux</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The terminal itself though is just the input-output structure. What
appears in the terminal and how you interact with the terminal is
determined by the <em>shell</em>
<ul>
<li>This is more important than it might seem. Two people running the
same terminal emulator may see <strong>very</strong> different things on
the screen</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-shell" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Shell</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <em>shell</em> dictates how the user interacts with the terminal
<ul>
<li>How commands are entered, what commands are allowed, how output is
displayed, etc</li>
<li>Basically the software that controls your interactions with the
terminal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are many possible shells, some of which have been around a
very long time, and many of which build on one another
<ul>
<li>Unix Shells
<ul>
<li>Bourne Shell (sh)</li>
<li>C Shell (csh)</li>
<li>Bourne Again Shell (bash)</li>
<li>Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)</li>
<li>Z Shell (zsh)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Windows Shells
<ul>
<li>cmd.exe</li>
<li>Powershell</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="shell-as-a-language" class="slide level2">
<h2>Shell as a Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shells are interactive environments, just like you have the
interactive environment in R</li>
<li>This means that the commands you type into the shell are a
programming language in and of themself!</li>
<li>Why script in this language rather than something else like R or
Python?
<ul>
<li>The shell commands are specifically tailored to working with
existing files on your computer</li>
<li>While you could achieve similar using other scripting languages, for
this sort of use-case, shell scripting tends to be more
straightforward</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="bash" class="slide level2">
<h2>BASH</h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ll focus on the BASH shell in this class</li>
<li>Tends to be the default in most Linux environments, which means most
servers you might connect to</li>
<li>MacOS defaults to the ZSH shell, which is largely built on top of
BASH and any that works in BASH will work in ZSH</li>
<li>In Windows, it is more difficult to get a terminal with the BASH
shell working.
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>considerable</strong> differences between Window’s
default PowerShell and BASH though</li>
<li>Best option is likely to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL2) which installs a lightweight virtual Linux environment on your
system in which you can launch and run a BASH shell.</li>
<li>Less great options would be trying to just work with online options
like Cocalc or Replit</li>

<section id="navigating-the-shell" class="slide level2">
<h2>Navigating the Shell</h2>

<h2>Spaces are Important!</h2>
<ul>
<li>A common topic that you need to remember when working in a shell is
that spaces have special meaning</li>
<li>Most shells use a space to <strong>separate between a command and an
argument/option, or between multiple arguments/options</strong></li>
<li>If you need to refer to a file path with spaces, you must either
quote it or “escape” the spaces with a backslash in front of each

<li>The columns that are matched across tables are called
<em>keys</em></li>
<li>The general idea is then to:
<ul>
<li>Set up your selection as usual from a single table</li>
<li>Join to that table another table</li>
<li>Specifying what columns in each table will act as keys along with a
conditional relating them
<ul>
<li>Most common condition is equality</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre ><code class="pgsql" style="font-size:0.6em">SELECT * FROM table_a
JOIN table_b
ON table_a.key_col = table_b.key_col;</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="column-names" class="slide level2">
<h2>Column Names</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you start refering to multiple table names in your query, you
might get overlapping column names
<ul>
<li>Columns names must be unique <strong>within a table</strong> but
might be the same <strong>across tables</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>To avoid ambiguity, you can preface a column name with the table it
is coming from, separated by a period</li>
<li>This is useful both for selecting the join key columns, but also for
selecting particular columns you want out of the joined table</li>
</ul>
<pre ><code class="pgsql">SELECT tab1.name, tab1.age, tab2.name
FROM tab1
JOIN tab2 ON tab1.age = tab2.age;</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="inner-join" class="slide level2">
<h2>(Inner) Join</h2>
<ul>
<li>The basic join only keeps rows from table 1 and table 2 that matched
on the given column keys
<ul>
<li>This is also called an <em>inner join</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any row in table 1 that had no counterpart in table 2 is left out
<ul>
<li>Identically for any row in table 2 that had no counterpart in table
1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key take-away is that it keeps what was in <strong>both</strong>
tables</li>
<li>If a value appears twice in one table, it will be duplicated in the
joined table as well
<ul>
<li>One reason that many times people try to join on columns that hold
unique values, but not always necesarry</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Left and Right Join</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, you don’t want to include <em>only</em> the rows that
were in both table</li>
<li>Maybe you want <strong>all</strong> the rows from one table, but
joining the other data when it is available</li>
<li>In these cases, you can use a <code class="python">LEFT JOIN</code>
or <code class="python">RIGHT JOIN</code>
<ul>
<li><code class="python">LEFT JOIN</code> is decidedly the more common,
and you can make any <code class="python">RIGHT JOIN</code> a
<code class="python">LEFT JOIN</code> just by flipping the table
ordering</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rows still need to have the same number of columns, so
<code class="python">NULL</code> values will be inserted for the
secondary table columns if it is missing a match</li>

<li>On occasion, you just want <em>all</em> the data from both tables
<ul>
<li>Matching where possible</li>
<li>But keeping data from both left or right tables if no match</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In these cases, a <code class="python">FULL OUTER JOIN</code> will
do what you want
<ul>
<li>Essentially does a <code class="python">LEFT JOIN</code> followed by
a <code class="python">RIGHT JOIN</code> with the existing table</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Anything without a match is still represented with
<code class="python">NULL</code> values</li>

<li>A <code class="python">CROSS JOIN</code> will return a table of all
of these possibilities</li>

generate your standard 52 card playing deck</li>

names!</li>
<li>Syntax looks just like column aliases, using

<ul>
<li>Usually after a <code class="python">FROM</code> or

helps some with readability</li>

<h2>Multiple Joins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing stops you from including multiple joins in your query</li>
<li>Each additional join links back to the current growing joined table

<li>This means a second join is treating the entire initial join as the
“left” table</li>
<li>Commonly, you’ll just be joining back to the original table, so it
won’t be apparent</li>

<ul>
<li>Hierarchy data can frequently be explored in this fashion</li>
<li>Comparisons between rows of a table</li>

else you won’t have a way to distinguish between which columns you
want</li>
